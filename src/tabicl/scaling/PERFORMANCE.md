# Performance log

Every measurement worth comparing, with the date it was taken and **what changed since
the previous entry**. `STATUS.md` carries the current numbers; this file carries how they
moved and why.

The reason this exists: several results in this project were compared across runs that
differed in more than one respect — context size, ensemble size, fit set, inference
config, even the pandas version — and each time the difference was attributed to the wrong
cause. A number without its configuration is not a measurement.

**Record for every entry:** date, task, device, `n_estimators`, `use_amp`, context size,
feature spec, fit set, and the one thing that changed.

## Current standing (2026-08-04)

RelBench, official protocol, calibrated: every setting chosen on validation, test touched
once, AMP off, selection and scoring at the same `n_estimators`.

| task | calibrated | selected configuration |
|---|---:|---|
| rel-f1 / driver-top3 | **80.70** | `max_columns=None`, no categorical, context 5,000 |
| rel-event / user-ignore | **78.11** | `max_columns=2`, categorical on, context 20,000 |
| rel-avito / user-visits | **64.85** | `max_columns=None`, no categorical, context 10,000 |
| rel-trial / study-outcome | **66.50** | `max_columns=2`, categorical on, context 10,000 |

Published comparisons: TabPFN-REL 79.98 / 85.38 / 66.68 / 76.43.

**Measurement floor: ±0.6.** Paired-gap sd is 0.29 on rel-event; absolute-score sd is
2.28. Differences under ~0.6 are not resolvable, and unpaired comparisons cannot resolve
five points. Pair everything.

## Run log

### 2026-08-04 — calibrated sweep completed
rel-avito **64.85** (was 64.46 hand-picked), rel-event **78.11** (unchanged).
*Changed:* AMP disabled; `select_estimators` now matches `n_estimators`; every setting
chosen on validation. rel-avito picked `max_columns=None` at 10,000 of 116,598 context
rows — 8.6% of the context, which is what takes it off a 46 GB GPU.
*Note:* rel-event's score did not move because the fix changed the selection *regime*, not
the selected *configuration*. It did expose that validation prefers the categorical blocks
(81.63 vs 81.40) where test puts them at −3.52 — genuine val/test disagreement on that
task.

### 2026-08-04 — AMP found to cost 7.3 AUC ⚠ largest single effect in the project
rel-event: CPU **80.93**, CUDA+AMP **73.61**, CUDA−AMP **80.93**.
*Changed:* device and `use_amp` only. Ruled out first: pandas (3.0.5 and 2.3.3 identical),
torch (2.4.1 CPU 80.93 vs 2.12 CPU 80.77), checkpoint (byte-identical).
*Cause:* AMP perturbs predictions by `max|Δp|≈1.8e-02`. Harmless on well-separated data
(synthetic 98.94 vs 98.93), costly where predictions cluster near the boundary.
**Every GPU number taken before this date is suspect.**

### 2026-08-04 — `n_estimators` flips the categorical verdict
rel-event, fit set fixed, AMP off, only `n_estimators` moving:

| `n_estimators` | plain | categorical | gap |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 75.02 | 77.89 | +2.87 |
| 2 | 79.65 | 78.70 | −0.95 |
| 4 | 80.92 | 77.40 | −3.52 |
| 8 | 81.03 | 77.97 | −3.06 |

*Changed:* nothing but ensemble size. Resolves a long-standing contradiction — both
earlier runners were right in their own regime.
*Mechanism:* plain gains 6 points from ensembling, categorical gains nothing. The extra
columns cost **ensemble diversity**, not feature quality.

### 2026-08-03 — categorical blocks measured across tasks
rel-trial +1.25, rel-f1 0.00 (no categoricals present), rel-event −3.21.
*Changed:* `top_k_categories=4`, `include_mode=True` added.
*Superseded:* the −3.21 was correct but only at `n_estimators=4`; see above.

### 2026-08-03 — context size is task-dependent
rel-avito 5,000 → 63.30, 10,000 → 64.85 (full 116,598 → 64.46).
rel-trial 1,000 → 61.39, 3,000 → 62.66 (full 12,954 → 65.40).
*Changed:* context rows only.
*Finding:* rel-avito's curve is flat, rel-trial's is not. Refutes "10–20k is enough on
every relational dataset". The +0.39 by which rel-avito's 10k beat full context is inside
the noise floor — read it as a tie, which is still the result that matters for cost.

### 2026-08-03 — column budget is a rescue, not a default
`max_columns=2`: rel-event **+3.0** (and the only way it runs at all), rel-trial **0.0**,
rel-f1 **−19.5**.
*Changed:* `max_columns` only.
*Finding:* a 22-point spread from one setting. rel-f1's children are small and entirely
numeric, so capping deletes signal; rel-event's 1,670 features over a 2.5M-row table are
mostly noise.

### 2026-08-03 — relation breadth on rel-trial
3 children 65.05 → 10 children 65.40.
*Changed:* number of child tables.
*Finding:* **+0.35 is inside the noise floor.** Seven extra relations bought nothing
measurable.

### Earlier — row chunking verified exact
`max|Δp| = 1.1e-05`, AUC identical with `offload="auto"` engaged, on both 128- and
161-column feature sets. Survived a direct attempt to break it while hunting the −3.21.

## Environment checklist

Run this before trusting any number from a new machine, container or pod. It has caught
two silent failures — the AMP default, and a pod reporting a healthy `nvidia-smi` with
`device_count 1` while every CUDA allocation failed.

1. **Reproduce a known baseline.** rel-event plain, `max_columns=2`, `n_estimators=4`,
   full context, AMP off → **80.9**. Anything else means the environment differs.
2. `torch.cuda` must allocate, not merely report a device.
3. Record `pandas`, `torch`, device, `use_amp`, checkpoint filename.
4. Never compare across entries that differ in more than one of those.
